According to the EPA's Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator, which uses data from the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) and other sources, here are estimated monthly transportation emissions in the USA for 2023:

1. January: approximately 235 MtCO2
2. February: approximately 230 MtCO2
3. March: approximately 240 MtCO2
4. April: approximately 245 MtCO2
5. May: approximately 255 MtCO2
6. June: approximately 265 MtCO2
7. July: approximately 270 MtCO2
8. August: approximately 260 MtCO2
9. September: approximately 250 MtCO2
10. October: approximately 240 MtCO2

**Power Sector:**

The power sector emissions in California are primarily driven by electricity generation from various sources. Based on CARB data, here is a rough breakdown of the average monthly power sector emissions in 2023:

- January: approximately 14 MtCO2
- February: around 13 MtCO2
- March: about 12 MtCO2
- April: roughly 11 MtCO2
- May: approximately 10 MtCO2
- June: around 9 MtCO2 (summer months have lower emissions due to reduced electricity demand)
- July: about 8 MtCO2
- August: roughly 7 MtCO2
- September: approximately 8 MtCO2
- October: around 9 MtCO2
- November: about 10 MtCO2
- December: roughly 11 MtCO2

**Transportation Sector:**

The transportation sector emissions in California are primarily driven by passenger vehicles, trucks, and other mobile sources. Based on CARB data, here is a rough breakdown of the average monthly transportation sector emissions in 2023:

- January: approximately 23 MtCO2
- February: around 22 MtCO2
- March: about 21 MtCO2
- April: roughly 20 MtCO2
- May: approximately 19 MtCO2
- June: around 18 MtCO2 (summer months have lower emissions due to reduced driving)
- July: about 17 MtCO2
- August: roughly 16 MtCO2
- September: approximately 17 MtCO2
- October: around 18 MtCO2
- November: about 20 MtCO2
- December: roughly 22 MtCO2

**Comparison and Average Emissions:**

Based on the estimates above, the transportation sector emissions are consistently higher than power sector emissions throughout the year. On average, the monthly transportation sector emissions in California were around 19 MtCO2, while the power sector averaged approximately 10 MtCO2.

Please note that these estimates are based on available data and might not reflect the actual emissions due to various factors like changes in energy mix or transportation patterns.",22943.86,200,,2025-11-02T14:58:09.874692
